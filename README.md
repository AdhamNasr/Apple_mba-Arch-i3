Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository is free-to-use/open-for-all instructions on building [Arch Linux][arch] on a MacBook Air 7,2. There is also plans on writing a shell script that I plan to use for future installs on the same system.

Please note that the install process is built for the system mentioned, and is tailored to work on that particular system only!

So please read through the README before installing it on a different machine.
